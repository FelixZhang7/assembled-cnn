**Abstract**

*Recent studies in image classification have demonstrated a variety of techniques for improving the performance 
of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, attempts to combine existing techniques to create a practical model 
are still uncommon. In this study, we carry out extensive experiments to validate that carefully assembling these techniques 
and applying them to a basic CNN model in combination can improve the accuracy and robustness of the model while minimizing 
the loss of throughput. For example, our proposed ResNet-50 shows an improvement in top-1 accuracy from 76.3% to 82.78%, 
and mCE improvement from 76.0% to 48.9%, on the ImageNet ILSVRC2012 validation set. With these improvements, inference 
throughput only decreases from 536 to 312. The resulting model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models with similar 
accuracy in terms of mCE and inference throughput. To verify the performance improvement in transfer learning, 
fine grained classification and image retrieval tasks were tested on several open datasets and showed that the improvement 
to backbone network performance boosted transfer learning performance significantly. Our approach achieved 1st place 
in the iFood Competition Fine-Grained Visual Recognition at CVPR 2019.*

## Honors

* Based on our repository, we achieved 1st place in [iFood Competition Fine-Grained Visual Recognition at CVPR 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ifood-2019-fgvc6/leaderboard).
* Assemble-ResNet50 achieve state-of-the-art with a ResNet-50 backbone on [ImageNet-C Leaderboard](https://github.com/hendrycks/robustness#imagenet-c-leaderboard)

## Getting Started

* This work was tested with Tensorflow 1.14.0, CUDA 10.0, python 3.6.

### Requirements

```bash
pip install Pillow sklearn requests Wand tqdm
```


### Data preparation

We assume you already have the following data:
* ImageNet2012 raw images and tfrecord. For this data, please refer to [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim#an-automated-script-for-processing-imagenet-data)
* For knowledge distillation, you need to add the teacher's logits to the TFRecord according to [here](./kd/README.md)
* For transfer learing datasets, refer to scripts in [here](./datasets)
* To download pretrained model, visit [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o8vj8_ZOPByjRKZzRPZMbuoKyxIwd_IZ?usp=sharing)
* To make mCE evaluation dataset. refer to [here](./datasets/CE_dataset/README.MD)

### Reproduce Results

First, download pretrained models from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o8vj8_ZOPByjRKZzRPZMbuoKyxIwd_IZ?usp=sharing).

```bash
DATA_DIR=/path/to/imagenet2012/tfrecord
MODEL_DIR=/path/pretrained/checkpoint
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python main_classification.py \
--eval_only=True \
--dataset_name=imagenet \
--data_dir=${DATA_DIR} \
--model_dir=${MODEL_DIR} \
--preprocessing_type=imagenet_224_256a \
--resnet_version=2 \
--resnet_size=152 \
--bl_alpha=1 \
--bl_beta=2 \
--use_sk_block=True \
--anti_alias_type=sconv \
--anti_alias_filter_size=3 
```

The expected final output is:

```
...
| accuracy:   0.841860 |
...
```
